# Credit_Worthiness_Classification

The credit risk associated with two sets of loans data is modeled using two techniques:

- Resampling methods

- Ensemble methods

Where resampling methods were applied, the following algorithms were evaluated by a regression classifier from the sklearn.linear_model library:

- No resampling
- Naive Random Oversampling 
- SMOTE
- Cluster Centroids
- SMOTEENN

Predictions from the algorithms above were evaluated by the following metrics:

- Balanced accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Imbalanced classification report

Where ensemble methods were applied, the following classification algorithms were evaluated:

- Balanced random forest classifier
- Easy ensemble classifier 

Predictions from the algorithms above were evaluated by the following metrics:

- Balanced accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Imbalanced classification report
